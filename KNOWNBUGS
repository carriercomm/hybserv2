^^^ leaf count is off by 1, except for services' current hub
(blackened actually does have 13 leaves)

if a channel is SecureOps and you:
/mode #chan -o+o chanserv badnick
^^^^badnick won't get deopped when chanserv rejoins
(badnick does not have autoop access)

test fuckover!!! -- make it use threads -- i don't think fork() has
access to the server fd ?? (No point, fuckover is gone)

directive to do a /msg opers@server when clones are detected
