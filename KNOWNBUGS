Weird LEVEL redefinition on all channels (kre)

It is possible to delete master_nick from tree, therefore causing hybserv
to crash - failing to find master from linked nicknames. Eventually, it
manages to write the DB that way so it cannot boot next time. (kre)

^^^ leaf count is off by 1, except for services' current hub
(blackened actually does have 13 leaves)

if a channel is SecureOps and you:
/mode #chan -o+o chanserv badnick
^^^^badnick won't get deopped when chanserv rejoins
(badnick does not have autoop access)

test fuckover!!! -- make it use threads -- i don't think fork() has
access to the server fd ??

test tcms

<sexy> instead of level 40
<sexy> you can rename level 40 to SuperOp

** continue with connect stuff (S: lines)

directive to do a /msg opers@server when clones are detected
