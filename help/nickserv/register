Syntax: %bREGISTER <password> [password recovery phrase]%b

This enables you to register your nickname with a
password so only you can use it.  Please try to
use obscure passwords that cannot be easily guessed.
Passwords *ARE* case sensitive.  Once you have
registered a nickname, you can use the %bSET%b and
%bACCESS%b commands to configure it.

Optionally, you can define a password recovery phrase
(usually consists of several common words) which will
enable you to use RECOVERPASS when you forget your
password.
