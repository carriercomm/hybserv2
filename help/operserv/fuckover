Syntax: %bFUCKOVER <nickname>%b

Initiates a server flood on <nickname> by sending rfc
codes between 200 and 512 until <nickname>'s client fails.
Extremely effective since services can't be flooded off.
Even if <nickname> attempts a nick change, services
continues flooding the new nick.  Most clients fail within
2-3 seconds.
