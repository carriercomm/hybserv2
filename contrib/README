  * hybrid_services.c - This module is written by Dragan Dosen. Its main
    functionality is to add aliases for /msg
    nickserv|chanserv|operserv|memoserv|statserv|seenserv|global as short
    commands (/ns, /cs, /ms etc.) for Hybrid7 IRCD.
	Obsolete: In newer incarnations of Hybrid7 the replacement module is
	m_services.c and it provides full functionality.

  * m_forcenick.c - This module is written by Dinko Korunic. Its primary
    and only duty is to provide FORCENICK capability within Hybrid7 IRCD,
    which gives both admins and Hybserv2 services power to arbitrary
    change users' nicknames.
	Obsolete: In newer incarnations of Hybrid7 the replacement module is
	m_services.c and it uses SVSNICK command.

  * m_svsnick.c - Same as before, but for IRCD's supporting SVSNICK
    command. Experimental, untested. Probably even obsolete.
	Obsolete: In newer incarnations of Hybrid7 the replacement module is
	m_services.c.

  * m_unkline.c - Module written by Dragan Dosen. A very helpful and
    recommended module which gives both services capability to remotely
    remove K-lines on Hybrid7 IRCD. You'll need appropriate shared{}
    blocks.
