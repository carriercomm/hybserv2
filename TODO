Today's MOTD
------------
As long as the answer is right, who cares if the question is wrong?


Pending bugs:
-------------
*) move c_noexpire into c_set_noexpire, as in NickServ
*) remove MaxTrace
*) fix absolutely ugly code formatting! [progress..]
*) remove ocasions of ugly strcpy
*) enable use of strlcat and strlcpy
*) move most of txt constants into a header, for easier localisation
*) check capabs of host server, including nicklen - report if nicklen >
   hybserv nicklen[!]
*) bunch of *old* stuff I've found around:
  - take IP bans into account
  - add /cs getkey (returns channel key), for same accesslvl as /cs invite
  - /cs info on private channel should require 1, not CMDINVITE
*) does not want to unforbid sometimes (??)
*) fix *LOCK functions (topic and mode lock)
*) temp ignores rotate (possible overflow)
*) > I plan on just setting the nickflood level higher in config.h, but
   could there be a configurable option via a operserv set command?
   Also, are there docs on what each operserv set variable is? Some of them
   are obvious, and then again, some aren't...
*) oper can't setup anything with other nicks
*) check dccprocess with similar bug as botprocess..
*) nickserv and chanserv have to be always enabled - fix this.
*) channel modes don't always get synced on restart
*) fix invalid gnote count
*) check for OnAccessList() without master nick call - only when necessary
*) remember to transfer access list in DeleteLink()
*) seems it is possible that nickname stays ghosted more than necessary if
   nick QUITs
*) send all mlock modes on channel creation
*) OperServ does not completely support hybrid7 modes yet, (for example
   .channel command or SECURE)
*) sed helpfiles so that they have proper time values
   NOTE: this should be done via %v or %t.. something like it
*) add flag for keeping other people's channel/nick status when
   reconnecting - i find it annonying to look at forced synching
*) on connect, services sometimes don't msg all the users [??]


Features yet to come:
---------------------
*) (13:37:00) padde: Any chance there could be coded an option, that would
   allow to specify a range of ports to be used to DCC services?
   (13:37:00) padde: would be usefull if the services is behind firewall
*)PuNkSterQFeTus: Heres an idea
  PuNkSterQFeTus: Instead of just /kill chan
  PuNkSterQFeTus: how about adding /kline chan
*) hide nick options..
*) save auth users before restart/die with a small ts..
*) blackbook for all operserv commands. searcheable, add, remove, list.
*) adx wishlist:
  1)
  <adx> for example, to create a new operserv's command
  <adx> "RESTRICT"
  <adx> you pass the mask, for example *!*@you.are.a.bad.guy
  <adx> then you can set some restrictions
  <adx> for example
  <adx> -nonickreg
  <adx> -max 5 (connections)
  <adx> -nolink
  <adx> etc...
  3)
  put operserv glines in oper.db
*) rewrite documentation
*) modularisation (_very_ unlikely to happen)
*) completely document API
*) localisation
*) misc stuff:
   private notes on channel and user records, available only to staff
   PGP/GPG keys per user
   multiple URL's, multiple email addresses (with limits)
   geek code
*) use btree&mmap (additionally use adns and glib)
*) improve block allocator
*) add cidr & ranged ip's
*) add tcpwrap capatibilities
*) ziplinks (perhaps use servlink?)
*) ideas by "John Binder" <jbinder@kgazd.bme.hu>:
   flood ctrl for services itself
   flood ctrl for channels: public flood, join-part flood, kick flood,
    deop flood, nick flood -> however, for some features it is obvious
    that chanserv/operserv will have to reside on channels, which I
    dislike (-kre)
*) implement modes flood trigger (and below)
*) add some features from http://www.appwatch.com/Linux/App/879/data.html
*) be compatibile with other ircds (!!)
*) umode +g ACCEPT list (BR's idea)
