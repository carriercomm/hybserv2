Some sort of TODO/planning program
(not necessarily in `right' order)
----------------------------------

*) add cidr & ranged ip's
*) add tcpwrap capatibilities
*) trace possible leaks
*) use btree&mmap (additionally use adns and glib)
*) improve block allocator
*) check older KNOWNBUGS
   - some, done. walter put back nickname len
*) weird level redefine on all channels 
*) cvsweb
*) misc stuff:
   private notes on channel and user records, available only to staff
   PGP/GPG keys per user
   space for realname, address, phone numbers
   multiple URL's, multiple email addresses (with limits)
   geek code
*) add collapse() and irccmp() (do we need this?)
*) hybrid7 features
*) implement modes flood trigger
*) add some features from http://www.appwatch.com/Linux/App/879/data.html
*) be compatibile with other ircds (!!)
*) unforbid
*) something quite _weird_ with CH_OPPED.. seems it isn't working in some
   special cases -- FIX FIX FIX THIS!
*) ideas by "John Binder" <jbinder@kgazd.bme.hu>:
   AUTOHALFOP CMDHALFOP support
   +h for hybserv7 (and AUTODEOP to remove +h)
   support +I
   flood ctrl for services itself
   flood ctrl for channels: public flood, join-part flood, kick flood,
    deop flood, nick flood -> however, for some features it is obvious
    that chanserv/operserv will have to reside on channels, which I
    dislike (-kre)
