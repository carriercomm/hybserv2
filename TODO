Today's MOTD
------------

"Beware of bugs in the above code;
 I have only proved it correct, not tried it"
 - Donald Knuth


Some sort of TODO/planning program:
(not necessarily in `right' order)
-----------------------------------

*) add cidr & ranged ip's
*) add tcpwrap capatibilities
*) trace possible leaks
*) use btree&mmap (additionally use adns and glib)
*) improve block allocator
*) cvsweb
*) misc stuff:
   private notes on channel and user records, available only to staff
   PGP/GPG keys per user
   space for realname, address, phone numbers
   multiple URL's, multiple email addresses (with limits)
   geek code
*) add collapse() and irccmp() (do we need this?)
*) implement modes flood trigger (and below)
*) add some features from http://www.appwatch.com/Linux/App/879/data.html
*) be compatibile with other ircds (!!)
*) something quite _weird_ with CH_OPPED.. seems it isn't working in some
   special cases -- FIX FIX FIX THIS!
*) ideas by "John Binder" <jbinder@kgazd.bme.hu>:
   flood ctrl for services itself
   flood ctrl for channels: public flood, join-part flood, kick flood,
    deop flood, nick flood -> however, for some features it is obvious
    that chanserv/operserv will have to reside on channels, which I
    dislike (-kre)
*) nptr->nick == nptr->master->nick in NickServ, userdb. Probably problems
   with unlink link copying routine.
   NOTE: Quickfixed this. However, I need to look at this more closely!
*) save services ignores


Done so far:
------------

*) hybrid7 features (Janos did it)
*) weird level redefine on all channels 
*) check older KNOWNBUGS
*) kline/unkline
*) .who not working?
*) better multiprocessor support (libhoard!)
*) Recover the lost ChangeLog entries
*) sfio support
*) crashing on /reload
*) linked tree problems
*) bcflood issue
*) anon cvs
*) we don't save information on servers on shutdown (statserv)
*) get rid of proxy ch. code (or make it better :) )
*) add support for solaris threads
*) trace weird SIGPIPE-s
*) umode command (in msg)
*) insert support for solaris threads
*) split and autorouting
*) SplitBuff() fixes
*) various older fixes, look in ChangeLog
*) fix NSSetMemoSignon issue, reported by monolith
   <monolith@mail.orblivion.com>
*) unforbid (chan/nick)
*) ............. and various not mentiones, since there were a lot of
   changes, look in ChangeLog
