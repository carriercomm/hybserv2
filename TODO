Today's MOTD
------------
"I know it all.  I just can't remember it all at once."


Pending bugs:
-------------
*) trace possible leaks
   NOTE: I've prepared some parts of code for trace -kre
*) nptr->nick == nptr->master->nick in NickServ, userdb. Probably problems
   with unlink link copying routine.
   NOTE: Quickfixed this. However, I need to look at this more closely!
   NOTE2: traced problem to DeleteLink(), done some more fixes, till
          weird
   NOTE3: still having problems.
*) OperServ does not completely support hybrid7 modes yet, (for example
   .channel command or SECURE)
*) fix "services" fighting by juping offending server/services
*) sed helpfiles so that they have proper time values
   NOTE: this should be done via %v or %t.. something like it
*) save services ignores
*) stuff from tools/* like encryptconf, encryptdb and doencrypt still do
   not support MD5


Features to come:
-----------------  
*) rewrite documentation
   ----> work in progress (Hwy)
*) add SVSNICK, SWHOIS, etc. for other IRCDs
*) modularisation (_very_ unlikely to happen)
*) completely document API
   ----> work in progress (Janos)
*) localisation
*) misc stuff:
   private notes on channel and user records, available only to staff
   PGP/GPG keys per user
   multiple URL's, multiple email addresses (with limits)
   geek code
*) use btree&mmap (additionally use adns and glib)
*) improve block allocator
*) add cidr & ranged ip's
*) add tcpwrap capatibilities
*) add mySQL/PostgreSQL support for databases
*) cvsweb
   ----> work in progress (Hwy and me)
*) ziplinks (perhaps use servlink?)
*) ideas by "John Binder" <jbinder@kgazd.bme.hu>:
   flood ctrl for services itself
   flood ctrl for channels: public flood, join-part flood, kick flood,
    deop flood, nick flood -> however, for some features it is obvious
    that chanserv/operserv will have to reside on channels, which I
    dislike (-kre)
   ----> work in progress (KrisDuv)
*) implement modes flood trigger (and below)
*) add some features from http://www.appwatch.com/Linux/App/879/data.html
*) be compatibile with other ircds (!!)
   ----> work in progress (me)
*) umode +g ACCEPT list (BR's idea)


Done so far:
------------
*) ike did flood protection, more to come soon - stay tuned :-)
*) channel verbose stuff
*) fixed stupid stupid stupid bug with not --fcnt
*) add collapse() and irccmp() (do we need this?)
*) operserv function to find improper TS channels and fix them
   ---> still needs to be further tested
*) space for realname, address, phone numbers
*) mailing list
*) applied (some are slightly modified) patches from KrisDuv
   <krisduv2000@yahoo.fr> in the following order:
   - fix stupid DefaultAccess problem which ment that anyone could alter
     global channel levels (how the heck didn't anyone notice that?)
   - fix broken lastseen updating for nicknames
   - fix broken "Last Seen" info in n_info()
*) Walter has fixed restart() problem that was affected with check_pid()
*) fix stupid bug that services +o people who match() O line, but have not
   registered with OperServ
*) something quite _weird_ with CH_OPPED.. seems it isn't working in some
   special cases -- FIX FIX FIX THIS!
*) added a lot of features from IrcBg
*) NEW bug in services, somehow connected with hashing code and servers -
   FindServer does not find servers -- I wonder how come no one found out
   bug in hashing code that existed from first versions of HybServ1 for
   masked servers! Ugh. -kre
*) ultra-buggy DeleteLink() for nicknames! - some fixes, yet to test
   throughly
*) use snprintf instead of sprintf or possibly use irc_sprintf from
   Hybrid
*) lower usage of time() via global variable synched in dotimer()
*) added fixts for channels and nicknames
*) added deletion of cleartext password from memory if crypt is on
*) services ignoring people sometimes
*) MD5 support (UseMD5 param_set)
*) fix order of checks for modes (+o/+h/+v), not (+o/+v/+h) (fl_)
*) let +h people use unban by default (if hyb7 is defined) (fl_)
*) safe write for settings.conf -> it can be truncated in some cases
*) if there is AutoKillClones in settings.conf with value 0, it is setup
   to 1; if there isn't, it is setup to 0 as it should be
*) weird chat problem reported by fl_ -> services do not respond
*) nasty .gline bug (dcc)
*) hybrid7 features (Janos did it)
*) weird level redefine on all channels 
*) check older KNOWNBUGS
*) kline/unkline
*) .who not working?
*) better multiprocessor support (libhoard!)
*) Recover the lost ChangeLog entries
*) sfio support
*) crashing on /reload
*) linked tree problems
*) bcflood issue
*) anon cvs
*) we don't save information on servers on shutdown (statserv)
*) get rid of proxy ch. code (or make it better :) )
*) add support for solaris threads
*) trace weird SIGPIPE-s
*) umode command (in msg)
*) insert support for solaris threads
*) split and autorouting
*) SplitBuff() fixes
*) various older fixes, look in ChangeLog
*) fix NSSetMemoSignon issue, reported by monolith
   <monolith@mail.orblivion.com>
*) unforbid (chan/nick)
*) <...> and various not mentioned, since there were a lot of changes,
   look in ChangeLog for more info
