Hybserv: Thu, 21 Jul 2005 20:06:04 +0200

	* since I've migrated to Subversion, we've lost automatic ChangeLog, so
		I'll be manually writing the changes every now and then
	* fix ghost to use instant collide, instead of KILL
	* don't allow ghosting self
	* don't allow op all if NOCHANOPS
	* fix clearnoexp, add pattern matching
	* updates for NickServ's list command:
		* implement matching flags
		* remove display limits
		* update documentation
	* rip off unseen - it was buggy and ugly anyway, and I'm not fond of
		repairing the broken code
	* regularly part channels which ChanServ shouldn't be on
	* code FORCENICK_LEN
	* when manually adding nicknames to collision list, notify them with
		proper messaging
	* add FORCENICK
	* add SVSNICK
	* update config.h defaults to Hybrid7 [yay, at last!]
