  * services cannot op/deop themselves when the command comes from
    regular users [Kamen Sabeff]

    spill control, less malloc/realloc stuff, less useless memsets
  - fix excessive writesock usage, fix several DCC-related issues
  - greplog fixes
  - fixes for NickServ's set EXPIRE
  * rewrote n_set* group of functions to allow SET <nickname> PARAM
    [flags] for any nickname linked with sender nickame and for admins to be
    able to change settings for users, if EMPOWERADMINMORE
  + add MinChanUsers, which allows administrator to set minimum channel
    users requirement for channel registration
  - fix reload coring services
  * new channels registered by opers are not NOEXPIRE by default
  + implement options for ChanServ LIST
  + add reason informations for nick and channel forbid [can be seen with
    info commands]

    Hybrid7

  - fix cs_invite() not to invite if channel isn't +i
  - fix SJOIN event to remove invite and ban exceptions properly, dump old
    data as required
  * rip off TakeOver() and rewrite o_secure() - idea is to use as much as
    possible of already written ChanServ code; new code will autoop Admins
    only if AutoOpAdmins is set.. and will do stuff is should have been
    doing already [but it didn't]
  ^ since I've migrated to Subversion, we've lost automatic ChangeLog, so
    I'll be manually writing the changes every now and then

  * when manually adding nicknames to collision list, notify them with
    proper messaging
  + add FORCENICK
  + add SVSNICK
  * update config.h defaults to Hybrid7 [yay, at last!]
