Hybserv-HEAD: Tue, 16 Aug 2005 15:52:03 +0200

  * add --enable-efence support
  * add --with-network, possible targets are idolnet, balcannet, hybrid,
    hybrid7, dancer
  * fix a dozen of format string vulnerabilities [thanks Ales Tokic for
    notice]
  * import newer match.c, which has '#' wildcard [thanks Ales Tokic for
    notice]
  * add --enable-asserts, --enable-gimmecore and --enable-daemontools
  * add --enable-warnings, --with-nicklen, --with-chanellen and
    --with-topiclen
  * several Solaris fuckups fixed
  * fix for invalid link count [fix from sofit]
  * fix for autovoice/autoop for operserv admins, problem with
    EMPOWERADMINS_MORE [fix from sofit]
  * global code and style cleanups
  * massive rewrite of includes and better detection of system
    headers/functions
  * fix trace to show channels when using -long parameters
  * Makefile and configure script changes
  * totally rip out mode +a support, since there is no anonops in recent
    Hybrid7
  * move autoconf stuff from autoconf/ to root .
  * halfops support is now under #define HYBRID7_HALFOPS
  * fix cs_invite() not to invite if channel isn't +i
  * fix SJOIN event to remove invite and ban exceptions properly, dump old
    data as required
  * rip off TakeOver() and rewrite o_secure() - idea is to use as much as
    possible of already written ChanServ code; new code will autoop Admins
    only if AutoOpAdmins is set.. and will do stuff is should have been
    doing already [but it didn't]
  * since I've migrated to Subversion, we've lost automatic ChangeLog, so
    I'll be manually writing the changes every now and then
  * fix ghost to use instant collide, instead of KILL
  * don't allow ghosting self
  * don't allow op all if NOCHANOPS
  * fix clearnoexp, add pattern matching
  * updates for NickServ's list command:
    * implement matching flags
    * remove display limits
    * update documentation
  * rip off unseen - it was buggy and ugly anyway, and I'm not fond of
    repairing the broken code
  * regularly part channels which ChanServ shouldn't be on
  * code FORCENICK_LEN
  * when manually adding nicknames to collision list, notify them with
    proper messaging
  * add FORCENICK
  * add SVSNICK
  * update config.h defaults to Hybrid7 [yay, at last!]
