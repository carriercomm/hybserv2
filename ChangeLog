Hybserv-HEAD

  + add OperServ TS saving when restart [from Brian Brazil]
  + fallback to plain KILL if FORCENICK doesn't suceed [from Brian Brazil]
  + save authentication TS when netsplit or restart, so users don't have
    to reauthenticate [from Brian Brazil]
  - fix network variables misoverride in configure
  + patch from Brian Brazil to send notices in m_forcenick
  - fix missing global help in helpserv as well as other similar bugs
  - fixed missing Nickserv ACCESS for administrators
  - fixed local listener issue [listening bug, resolve bug]
  ^ moved compatibility stuff into compat/, made fallbacks if we
    don't have strtoul, strerror, strdup
  ^ new logging scheme applied
  + add password recovery and recover phrase into NickServ [thanks bane!]
  - fixes for broken getaddrinfo() on some glibc2 platforms [thanks knight
    and adx]

Hybserv-1.9.1

  ^ stage it to REL_1_9_1 [09/26/2005]
  + Substitute now works for dcc motd and server [logon] motd
  * rewrote Substitute code
  * rewrote core string/array handling functions SplitBuf() and
    GetString()
  + add basic IPv6 support and getaddrinfo/getnameinfo stuff
  + add configurable FORCENICK/SVSNICK prefix
  + strlcat/strlcpy merge, lot of memory stuff fixes, better internal
    spill control, less malloc/realloc stuff, less useless memsets
  - fix excessive writesock usage, fix several DCC-related issues
  - greplog fixes
  - fixes for NickServ's set EXPIRE
  * rewrote n_set* group of functions to allow SET <nickname> PARAM
    [flags] for any nickname linked with sender nickame and for admins to be
    able to change settings for users, if EMPOWERADMINMORE
  + add MinChanUsers, which allows administrator to set minimum channel
    users requirement for channel registration
  - fix reload coring services
  * new channels registered by opers are not NOEXPIRE by default
  + implement options for ChanServ LIST
  + add reason informations for nick and channel forbid [can be seen with
    info commands]
  - fix smaller leak in DeleteChan
  - fix forbidden channels dissapearing after save
  + add --enable-efence support
  + add --with-network, possible targets are idolnet, balcannet, hybrid,
    hybrid7, dancer
  - fix a dozen of format string vulnerabilities [thanks Ales Tokic for
    notice]
  + import newer match.c, which has '#' wildcard [thanks Ales Tokic for
    notice]
  + add --enable-asserts, --enable-gimmecore and --enable-daemontools
  + add --enable-warnings, --with-nicklen, --with-chanellen and
    --with-topiclen
  - several Solaris fuckups fixed
  - fix for invalid link count [fix from sofit]
  - fix for autovoice/autoop for operserv admins, problem with
    EMPOWERADMINS_MORE [fix from sofit]
  * global code and style cleanups
  * massive rewrite of includes and better detection of system
    headers/functions
  - fix trace to show channels when using -long parameters
  * Makefile and configure script changes
  * totally rip out mode +a support, since there is no anonops in recent
    Hybrid7
  ^ move autoconf stuff from autoconf/ to root .
  * halfops support is now under #define HYBRID7_HALFOPS
  - fix cs_invite() not to invite if channel isn't +i
  - fix SJOIN event to remove invite and ban exceptions properly, dump old
    data as required
  * rip off TakeOver() and rewrite o_secure() - idea is to use as much as
    possible of already written ChanServ code; new code will autoop Admins
    only if AutoOpAdmins is set.. and will do stuff is should have been
    doing already [but it didn't]
  ^ since I've migrated to Subversion, we've lost automatic ChangeLog, so
    I'll be manually writing the changes every now and then
  * fix ghost to use instant collide, instead of KILL
  * don't allow ghosting self
  * don't allow op all if NOCHANOPS
  - fix clearnoexp, add pattern matching
  * updates for NickServ's list command:
    + implement matching flags
    + remove display limits
    ^ update documentation
  * rip off unseen - it was buggy and ugly anyway, and I'm not fond of
    repairing the broken code
  * regularly part channels which ChanServ shouldn't be on
  + code FORCENICK_LEN
  * when manually adding nicknames to collision list, notify them with
    proper messaging
  + add FORCENICK
  + add SVSNICK
  * update config.h defaults to Hybrid7 [yay, at last!]
