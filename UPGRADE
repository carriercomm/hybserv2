These are upgrade facts on different Hybserv versions.

1.9.2 -> 1.9.3
--------------
* New NotifyOpers directive in settings.conf
* New SecureMessaging directive in settings.conf
* Removed RECORD_SPLIT_TS from config.h. It is useless now.
* MaxLogs in settings.conf is required if you want to enable log rotation
  at all. Note that values bigger 1024 are a really bad idea.
* MinNickAge in settings.conf
* current password on drop is now required
* old password on set password is now required to sucessfully change
  to new password

1.9.1 -> 1.9.2
--------------
* New LogPath directive in settings.conf. This must be manually added.
  Example:
  Logpath  "logs"

1.8.0 -> 1.9.0
--------------
* New OperServIgnoreDB directive in settings.conf. This must be manually
  added. If this file doesn't exist, Hybserv will create it. Example:
  OperServIgnoreDB   "ignore.db"

-------------
Upgrade instructions for versions prior to 1.8.0 do not exist.
