Some short notes:

The former Hybserv development team has decided to spin off and focus its
energies towards the HYBSERV2 project. Like the name implies this new
version will be even better then that last. If their is something you
would like to see added to HYBSERV2 please let us know as we are always
looking for new ideas.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Per Sidewnder's (Cosine's) request - HYBSERV will no longer be supported.
So if you have some questions or problems, please *upgrade* first to a
version listed in the HYBSERV2 dir.

The latest version is 1.8.0 <--------------------

HybServ was first coded by Patrick Alken (wnder@underworld.net) and is now

code or the credits.

HybServ was specifically designed to run with hybrid ircd, although it
*should* work with CSr as well.  You may receive the hybrid irc daemon
from ftp.blackened.com in /pub/irc/hybrid. These services (more or less
same code) are currently used by EFNet / DalNet / ICQ / WFNet / HybNet /
EFNow / Openprojects Network.

INSTALLATION

  Read the INSTALL file :-).

#########################################################################
# BUGS -  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE mail any bugs you find to                #
# kreator@fly.srk.fer.hr                                                #

We can't fix bugs if no one reports them!

The criteria for reporting bugs is somewhat specific. 

1. We need to know exactly how to reproduce the bugs. Use
   #define DEBUG in include/config.h to make sure server
   will produce corefile.

2. If you do not know how to reproduce the bug at will, please
   do the following: #define EXTREMEDEBUG in config.h, which 
   will cause the file "hybserv.hubinfo" to be created. If the 
   bug occurs again, email me the hybserv.hubinfo file, and it 
   will give us a starting point.

# Running Hybserv                                       #
#########################################################

Make sure that each hub server you have specified in your config file has
C/N lines for HybServ matching the password in the first field of the S:
line and the server name specified in the N: line.  Also, if you wish to
enable jupes (#define ALLOW_JUPES), you *MUST* give services an H: line in
ircd.conf.

Configuration examples:
NOTE:
  Suppose the host name of services is "services.name" with an ip of
  1.2.3.4, and that server accepting the services has name
  "server.shomewhere" with ircd class "server" (or class 1).

Required statements in ircd.conf for Hybrid5/6:
  C:1.2.3.4:password:services.name::1
  N:1.2.3.4:password:services.name::1
  H:*:*:services.name
NOTE:
  You can leave out H line if you don't want to use server jupes and
  G-Lines.
NOTE:
  We recommend using services on same server that is your hub, and then
  you can use 127.0.0.1 as address in C/N lines (which will give you some
  performance, since traffic will go through loop back device).

However in Hybrid 7 to accomplish the same you have to put in ircd.conf
following code:
  connect {
    name = "services.name";
    host = "1.2.3.4";
    send_password = "password";
    accept_password = "password";
    hub_mask = "*";
    class = "server";
  };
NOTE:
  You can leave out hub_mask if you don't want to use server jupes and
  G-Lines.

In hybserv.conf configuration should be as follows:
  S:password:hub.server.somewhere:6667
  N:services.name:Hybrid services

When you have compiled HybServ and edited the necessary files, simply type
./hybserv which should start daemon properly. If it is not in process
list, check hybserv.log which should state reasons of failure. 

Then, go on IRC and type:
  /msg OperServ identify <password>

Assuming OperServ is the OperServNick defined in settings.conf and you
have given yourself a O: line in hybserv.conf. You should be allowed to
give OperServ commands through /msg or DCC CHAT.  

For a list of commands do:
  /msg OperServ help.

Most commands may also be done through DCC CHAT, and in fact more commands
are available through DCC CHAT. Simply /dcc chat OperServ to connect, and
.help

I have tried to make HybServ fully compatible with TCM (linking wise). If
you wish HybServ to be part of your TCM botnet, read TCM-LINKING for
instructions.  If you have no idea what a TCM bot is, don't worry about it
:-).

If you enabled NickServ, ChanServ, MemoServ etc. in config.h, you can get
lists of their commands through /msg *Serv help. NickServ and ChanServ
have several commands that can only be executed by administrators.  This
means you must match an O: line (with an "a" flag) in hybserv.conf and be
registered with OperServ to use them. This can be done by typing /msg
OperServ password, these commands CANNOT be accessed by DCC Chat. 

IMPORTANT NOTE! If you use Hybrid or Hybrid-compatible IRC daemon, you
should enable Q-lines (quarantined nickname) for services-reserved
nicknames because of obvious security reasons:
  Q:NickServ:This nickname is reserved.
  Q:ChanServ:This nickname is reserved.
  Q:OperServ:This nickname is reserved.

However Q lines changed in Hybrid-7 too, so you should copy/paste these
lines:
  quarantine {
    name = "NickServ";
    reason = "This nickname is reserved";
  };
  quarantine {
    name = "ChanServ";
    reason = "This nickname is reserved";
  };
  quarantine {
    name = "OperServ";
    reason = "This nickname is reserved";
  };
