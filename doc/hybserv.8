.SH NAME
hybserv \- daemon which provides Hybrid-compatible IRC services
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBhybserv\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This manual page documents briefly the \fBhybserv\fR
command.
.PP
\fBhybserv\fR is an IRC Services server, a daemon
which connects to a Hybrid-compatible IRC server and provides range
of specialized services. Usually those are IRC nickname and channel
registration services, providing users the means to officially
register their nicknames and channels and regain control of them
whenever needed. The latter to is supposed to prevent the takeovers
and notorious IRC wars, especially on a larger IRC network.
.PP
When successfully configured and connected,
\fBhybserv\fR appears like any other IRC server.
Technically it is a virtual server providing one or several
sub-services acting like virtual nicknames with administrator or
opererator flags.  Those are typically +oi, although services should
not need any special flags to function correctly.
.PP
In its default configuration (i.e. with all sub-services enabled)
\fBhybserv\fR provides NickServ, ChanServ, MemoServ,
OperServ, StatServ, and Global, which are described individually
below.
.PP
NickServ allows users to register their nicknames. Every client can
become an owner for a nickname by simply defining his own password
and identifying each time on IRC network login. NickServ can enforce
this registration as mandatory, and it can kill or rename users
which do not successfully complete the process of identification in a
given period of time. The righteous owners of nicks can also reclaim
their nicknames with their registration password, in case of
necessity. Nickname registration allows usage of many other services
which are described in the following paragraphs.
.PP
ChanServ allows users with registered nicknames to register their
own channels. This registration is enforced with a simple access
list which defines the access of channel members. The owner (founder
of a channel) and his successor can specify for each user (or
nickname mask) what is his status in channel: for instance does an
op, voice, halfop flags. Those flags can be auto- type (nickname
gets a flag automatically when joining the channel) or cmd- type
(with a proper access, nickname has to manually enter a command to
get an action done). ChanServ can also maintain a blacklist of users
with either nicknames or masks which will be automatically kicked
and banned from the channel.
.PP
MemoServ is a message service for registered nicknames. As opposed
to typical IRC which is a real-time service, it has got off-line
capabilities. This means users are able to send messages to each
other for later reading, typically on login to an IRC network.
.PP
StatServ is a statistical service mainly to be used by admins, but
it has got some possibly useful information for users too. It shows
active services' admins as well as all active IRC operators (globals
and locals), number of registered nicknames and channels and
miscellaneous other statistics.
.PP
Global messages every user on connect with contents of logon.news
and allows operators to easily send global messages and
notifications to all users.
