.SH NAME
hybserv \- daemon which provides Hybrid-compatible IRC services
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBhybserv\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This manual page documents briefly the \fBhybserv\fR
command.
.PP
\fBhybserv\fR is an IRC Services server, a daemon
which connects to a Hybrid-compatible IRC server and provides range
of specialized services. Usually those are IRC nickname and channel
registration services, providing users the means to officially
register their nicknames and channels and regain control of them
whenever needed. The latter to is supposed to prevent the takeovers
and notorious IRC wars, especially on a larger IRC network.
.PP
Hybserv2 is a new and improved version of the now unsupported Hybserv,
sporting new features, bugfixes, and more. Hybserv was specifically
designed to run with Hybrid6/7 IRCd, although it should work with Ratbox
IRCd and any other Hybrid-based IRCd. These services (more or less same
code) are currently used by several other networks such as idolNET,
BalcanNET, BGNet, BGFree, UniBG, BCNet, GunNet, ShakeIT, FreeWorld,
IRCBG, FreeNode/OPN.
.PP
When successfully configured and connected,
\fBhybserv\fR appears like any other IRC server.
Technically it is a virtual server providing one or several
sub-services acting like virtual nicknames with administrator or
opererator flags.  Those are typically +oi, although services should
not need any special flags to function correctly.
.PP
In its default configuration (i.e. with all sub-services enabled)
\fBhybserv\fR provides NickServ, ChanServ, MemoServ,
OperServ, StatServ, and Global, which are described individually
below.
.TP
\fBNickServ\fR
NickServ allows users to register their nicknames. Every
client can become an owner for a nickname by simply defining
his own password and identifying each time on IRC network
login. NickServ can enforce this registration as mandatory,
and it can kill or rename users which do not successfully
complete the process of identification in a given period of
time. The righteous owners of nicks can also reclaim their
nicknames with their registration password, in case of
necessity.  Nickname registration allows usage of many other
services which are described in the following paragraphs.
.TP
\fBChanServ\fR
ChanServ allows users with registered nicknames to register
their own channels. This registration is enforced with a
simple access list which defines the access of channel
members. The owner (founder of a channel) and his successor
can specify for each user (or nickname mask) what is his
status in channel: for instance does an op, voice, halfop
flags. Those flags can be auto- type (nickname gets a flag
automatically when joining the channel) or cmd- type (with a
proper access, nickname has to manually enter a command to get
an action done). ChanServ can also maintain a blacklist of
users with either nicknames or masks which will be
automatically kicked and banned from the channel.
.TP
\fBMemoServ\fR
MemoServ is a message service for registered nicknames. As
opposed to typical IRC which is a real-time service, it has
got off-line capabilities. This means users are able to send
messages to each other for later reading, typically on login
to an IRC network.
.TP
\fBStatServ\fR
StatServ is a statistical service mainly to be used by admins,
but it has got some possibly useful information for users too.
It shows active services' admins as well as all active IRC
operators (globals and locals), number of registered nicknames
and channels and miscellaneous other statistics.
.TP
\fBGlobal\fR
Global usually messages every user on connect with contents of
logon.news and allows operators to easily send global messages
and notifications to all users.
.SH "OPTIONS"

Per Sidewnder's (Cosine's) request, original Hybserv will no longer be
supported. So if you have questions or some problems, please upgrade
first to a recent stable or even to a development version.  The former
Hybserv development team has decided to spin off and focus its energy
towards the Hybserv2 project. Like the name implies, this new version is
even better. If there is something you would like to see added to
Hybserv2, please let us know as we are always looking for fresh ideas.

Hybserv was first coded by
Patrick

and is now maintained by the Hybserv2 coding team, unless otherwise
mentioned in the code. For more information see the README file in
Hybserv2 distribution.
