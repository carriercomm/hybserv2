Starting from 1.7.4 release, HybServ can use sfio library.

Sfio library is portable enhanced library for managing I/O streams. It
provides similar functionality to the ANSI C Standard I/O functions known
collectively as Stdio. However, it has a distinct interface and is
generally faster and more robust than most Stdio implementations.

Sfio also introduces a number of new features and concepts beyond Stdio
stream I/O processing:
  * Automatic locking to avoid concurrent stream accesses,
  * I/O disciplines to pre/post-process read/write data from/to streams,
  * Stream stacking for recursive processing of nested streams,
  * Stream pooling for automatic stream synchronization when I/O
    operations are performed on different streams,
  * Buffer reservation for safe access to the internal buffers of streams,
  * Robust handling of variable-sized records, and
  * Extensible printf/scanf-like formatting I/O operations.

In HybServ we can use libstdio as wrapper for most of stdio functions
(except for rename()). You can turn on this support with following
options (not neccessary if library is already installed in standard
include/library paths):
  --with-sfio-lib=DIR     Directory containing sfio library
  --with-sfio-inc=DIR     Directory containing sfio include files

Example:
  ./configure --with-sfio-lib=/home/kreator/work/sfio/lib \
    --with-sfio-inc=/home/kreator/work/sfio/include

Configure script will automagically detect multithreaded environment and
preferably use stdio-mt and sfio-mt for multithreaded hybserv, as well as
stdio and sfio for unithreaded hybserv.
