Starting from 1.7.4 release, HybServ can use hoard library.

The Hoard memory allocator is a fast, scalable, and memory-efficient
memory allocator for shared-memory multiprocessors.

Multithreaded programs that perform dynamic memory allocation do not scale
because the heap is a bottleneck. When multiple threads simultaneously
allocate or deallocate memory from the heap, they will be serialized while
waiting for the heap lock. Programs making intensive use of the heap
actually slow down as the number of processors increases.

Hoard is a fast allocator that solves this problem. In addition, it has
very reasonable bounds on memory consumption.

You can turn on this support with following options (not neccessary if
library is already installed in standard include/library paths):
  --with-hoard-lib=DIR    Directory containing hoard library
 
NOTE: this options depends on multithreaded environment!

Example:
  ./configure --with-hoard-lib=/home/kreator/work/libhoard-2.0.5

Configure script will automagically detect multithreaded environment and
use librt with libthread.
