    <para>
      Per Sidewnder's (Cosine's) request, original Hybserv will no longer be
      supported. So if you have questions or some problems, please upgrade
      first to a recent stable or even to a development version.  The former
      Hybserv development team has decided to spin off and focus its energy
      towards the Hybserv2 project. Like the name implies, this new version is
      even better. If there is something you would like to see added to
      Hybserv2, please let us know as we are always looking for fresh ideas.
