    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>
      This manual page documents briefly the <command>&dhbinary;</command>
      command.
    </para>

    <para>
      <command>&dhbinary;</command> is an IRC Services server, a daemon
      which connects to a Hybrid-compatible IRC server and provides range
      of specialized services. Usually those are IRC nickname and channel
      registration services, providing users the means to officially
      register their nicknames and channels and regain control of them
      whenever needed. The latter to is supposed to prevent the takeovers
      and notorious IRC wars, especially on a larger IRC network.
    </para>

    <para>
      When successfully configured and connected,
      <command>&dhbinary;</command> appears like any other IRC server.
      Technically it is a virtual server providing one or several
      sub-services acting like virtual nicknames with administrator or
      opererator flags.  Those are typically +oi, although services should
      not need any special flags to function correctly.
    </para>

    <para>
      In its default configuration (i.e. with all sub-services enabled)
      <command>&dhbinary;</command> provides NickServ, ChanServ, MemoServ,
      OperServ, StatServ, and Global, which are described individually
      below.
    </para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>NickServ</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            NickServ allows users to register their nicknames. Every
            client can become an owner for a nickname by simply defining
            his own password and identifying each time on IRC network
            login. NickServ can enforce this registration as mandatory,
            and it can kill or rename users which do not successfully
            complete the process of identification in a given period of
            time. The righteous owners of nicks can also reclaim their
            nicknames with their registration password, in case of
            necessity.  Nickname registration allows usage of many other
            services which are described in the following paragraphs.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>ChanServ</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            ChanServ allows users with registered nicknames to register
            their own channels. This registration is enforced with a
            simple access list which defines the access of channel
            members. The owner (founder of a channel) and his successor
            can specify for each user (or nickname mask) what is his
            status in channel: for instance does an op, voice, halfop
            flags. Those flags can be auto- type (nickname gets a flag
            automatically when joining the channel) or cmd- type (with a
            proper access, nickname has to manually enter a command to get
            an action done). ChanServ can also maintain a blacklist of
            users with either nicknames or masks which will be
            automatically kicked and banned from the channel.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>MemoServ</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            MemoServ is a message service for registered nicknames. As
            opposed to typical IRC which is a real-time service, it has
            got off-line capabilities. This means users are able to send
            messages to each other for later reading, typically on login
            to an IRC network.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>StatServ</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            StatServ is a statistical service mainly to be used by admins,
            but it has got some possibly useful information for users too.
            It shows active services' admins as well as all active IRC
            operators (globals and locals), number of registered nicknames
            and channels and miscellaneous other statistics.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Global</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Global usually messages every user on connect with contents of
            logon.news and allows operators to easily send global messages
            and notifications to all users.
