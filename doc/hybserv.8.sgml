    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>This manual page documents briefly the
      <command>&dhpackage;</command> command.</para>

    <para>This manual page was written for the &debian; distribution
      because the original program does not have a manual page.</para>

    <para><command>&dhpackage;</command> is an IRC Services server, a daemon
    which connects to an IRC server and provides services such as
    NickServ and ChanServ to users, allowing them to register their
    nicknames and channels (the latter to prevent the notorious `channel
    takeovers' that were rampant on EFnet, which to date still does not 
    provide IRC services.)</para>

    <para><command>&dhpackage;</command> appears like any other IRC server
    on a network and all of the services nicknames act as clients with
    customizable user flags (typically +oi, although they do not need
    any special flags to function correctly.)</para>

    <para><command>&dhpackage;</command> provides, in its default configuration, NickServ, ChanServ, MemoServ,
    OperServ, StatServ, and Global, which are
    described individually below.</para>

    <para>NickServ allows for registration of nicknames; it can enforce
    this registration on users who do not own the nicknames they use.
    Owners of nicks can also 'ghost' their nickname with their registration password,
    in case someone has taken possession of it or it is a 'ghost' that
    has not timed out yet.</para>

    <para>ChanServ allows users with registered nicknames to register channels;
    this registration is enforced with an 'access list' which allows the owner to specify who automatically gets operator status in a channel,
    or voice, or halfops if supported by the IRC server. ChanServ can also
    maintain a blacklist of sorts where users under certain hostmasks will automatically be kicked and banned from the channel.</para>

<para>MemoServ is simply a message service for people who have registered
nicknames - they are able to send static messages to each other for later
reading.</para>

<para>StatServ and Global play minor roles - Global displays the logon.news (in /etc/hybserv) and allows operators to easily send global messages to all users, and StatServ is much like a glorified ircd STATS call.</para>
