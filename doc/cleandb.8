Per Sidewnder's (Cosine's) request, original Hybserv will no longer be
supported. So if you have questions or some problems, please upgrade
first to a recent stable or even to a development version.  The former
Hybserv development team has decided to spin off and focus its energy
towards the Hybserv2 project. Like the name implies, this new version is
even better. If there is something you would like to see added to
Hybserv2, please let us know as we are always looking for fresh ideas. 
.PP
Hybserv was first coded by
Patrick
Alken
<wnder@underworld.net>
and is now maintained by the Hybserv2 coding team, unless otherwise
mentioned in the code. For more information see the README file in
Hybserv2 distribution.
