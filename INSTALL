INSTALLATION 

 The fast and easy way:

     ./install.fast

   NOTE: If you use this script, you must make sure config.h
         is correctly configured prior to running the script;
         also - using this script will default to installing
         HybServ in /usr/local/hybserv/, unless you first edit
         Makefile.in

 In order to compile HybServ, you should perform the following steps:

    1) Enter the hybserv-x.x.x tree and run ./configure, a GNU 
       configure script, which should find whatever it needs for
       compilation.

    2) Edit include/config.h and change the information to suit
       your IRC Network.  Also, be sure to edit bin/hybserv.conf
       to set up the services to work with your network. (This is
       the file where you can give others access to HybServ)

    3) Run 'make' in the hybserv-x.x.x tree to compile the package.
       When make finishes, you'll probably want to: 'strip bin/hybserv'
       to remove debugging symbols from the file, since the author
       is the only one who really uses it.  It also decreases the 
       file size greatly.

    4) Finally, become root if necessary, and run 'make install' to 
       install hybserv on your system.  The default install directory 
       is /usr/local/hybserv.  This will automatically chown the install
       directory to the same user who ran the configure script, so it
       won't run as root.  You can change the user by editing Makefile.

    5) You may wish to remove any objects/binaries created during
       installation.  You can do this via 'make clean'.  If you
       wish to remove any configure generated files as well, use
       'make distclean'.

	 ** Note: if you want to install hybserv in a directory other than
            /usr/local/hybserv, you must run the configure script with 
            the --prefix option.

    For example, if you want to install hybserv in /home/mydir:

       ./configure --prefix=/home/mydir
       make
       make install

     Then, hybserv will be installed in /home/mydir/hybserv.

  HybServ was originally developed under Linux 2.0 on a Pentium 200.
HybServ is known to compile cleanly on the following operating systems,
and may compile on others.

    Linux 2.4.x (all)
    FreeBSD 4.2 (and older)
    OpenBSD 2.7 (and older)
    Solaris 2.7 (and older)
    Digital Unix 4.0

 If you are unable to compile HybServ, please let me know at
wnder@underworld.net.  Bug reports/suggestions may be sent to the 
same address.  Now, go read the README :-).
